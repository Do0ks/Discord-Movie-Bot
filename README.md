<b><u>Discription:</u></b>  
Play your personal collection of movies in discord with your friends and family and give them control to watch what they want to! Simple to set up and DOES NOT break Discords TOS!

<b><u>Prerequisite:</u></b>  
-A Plex media server loaded with the movies you would like to share.  
-A extra Discord user account. (Not required if you don't mind using your account to stream. Recommend a second monitor so you're not tied down streaming)  
-A bit of setup time.   
-A second computer is a HUGE help for this.  

<b><u>Preperation:</u></b>  
Load the code in whatever you want to use to host the bot. Once online, find your plex Token (See: https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/ )  

Use your personal account to stream the video to discord on the computer your plex server is located.  
That's it! Enjoy!  


<b><u>FAQ:</u></b>  
<b>Q)</b> Why do I need a personal account?  
<b>A)</b> As we know, it's not possible to stream movies from a Discord bot. This will never change so this is the best we can get. Thinking outside the box.  
  
<b>Q)</b> How is this not breaking Discords TOS? How is this not a self bot?  
<b>A)</b> Easy! Think about it. Discord doesn't want user accounts to be automated. This is where the term self bot comes from. Well, the extra user accout you have to use is fully controlled by you, the user, not a bot. The bot is controlling the plex server, not the user account. Think of this bot as a remote controller that you pass to your friends.  

<b>Q)</b> BUT, COPYRIGHTS!  
<b>A)</B> Fair, this is a big one. however, under the Fair Use Act you ARE allowed to stream movies, music or whatever that has copyrights so long as you incluse some kind of commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching or scholarship.  Just keep your chat ingaged about the movie and throw some criticism one in awhile and you'll be fine. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)  

<b>Q)</b> Does the bot come with movies?  
<b>A)</B> Obviously no. This should go without saying if you choose to stream stolen movies thats on you. I take no responsibility for what you stream. Use your tinkers....
